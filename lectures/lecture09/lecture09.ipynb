    "The `re` module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match using a __search pattern__ \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here are some common elements to have in your __search pattern__:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specific patterns:**\n",
    "    * **Specific letter characters** (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, ...): Matches any occurrence of the specified letter in the string.\n",
    "    * **Specific numerical digits** (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, ...): Matches any occurrence of the specified digit.\n",
    "    * **Specific special characters** (e.g., `*`, `$`, ...): Matches any occurrence of the specified special character. Special characters need to be preceded by a `\\` (e.g., `\\.` for a period, `\\$` for a dollar sign).\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **General patterns:**\n",
    "    * **Numerical digits**: `\\d` matches any digit (numbers `0`–`9`).\n",
    "    * **Any single character**: `.` matches _any_ single character.\n",
    "    * **Any letter or character from a set**: `[]` allows you to specify a set of characters to search for (e.g., `[a-n]` matches any lowercase letter from `a` to `n`).\n",
    "    * **One or more occurrences**: `+` specifies one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern (e.g., `a+` matches \"a\", \"aa\", etc.).\n",
    "    * **Exact number of occurrences**: `{}` specifies an exact number of occurrences of the preceding pattern (e.g., `a{6}` matches exactly six \"a\" characters).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Anchors for start/end of string**:\n",
    "    * **End of string**: `$` matches the end of the string (e.g., `\\d$` matches a string that ends with a digit).\n",
    "    * **Beginning of string**: `^` matches the beginning of the string (e.g., `^A` matches any string that starts with \"A\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Grouping and naming**:\n",
    "    * **Grouping patterns**: `()` is used to group part of your search pattern. Everything inside the parentheses is treated as a single unit, and you can capture and reference this group.\n",
    "    * **Named groups**: `(?P<name>...)` defines a named group with the specified name, allowing you to reference this part of the match later (e.g., `(?P<year>\\d{4})` for a four-digit year).\n",
