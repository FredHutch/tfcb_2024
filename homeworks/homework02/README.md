# Homework 2: Unix shell

This homework will assess your ability to run commands in the shell and make a simple script.

Replace the lines specified in _italics_ with your answers and save as a text file.


## Problem 0

**60 points**

Complete the interactive tutorial.

_The interactive tutorial ran smoothly for the most part. One point of frustration was when it asked us to count files in lecture04. When I typed wc --help in the command line, there was not a useful flag for counting files._


## Problem 1

**20 points**

**Write a script that outputs some user and location data and moves that output to a newly created directory**

Make a single script that prints out a file called question01.txt. 

This file should contain the following text:

  My username is (your username, but the script needs to work for anyone, not just you)

  My home directory is (your home directory, but the script needs to work for anyone, not just you)

  The contents of the tfcb_2023/lectures/lecture04/ directory are

  (prints the contents of that directory)

This script should also create a directory called homework02, and move question01.txt into the homework02 directory.

An example output answer should be:

My username is campbellm <br>
My home directory is /Users/melody <br>
The contents of the tfcb_2023/lectures/lecture04/ directory are<br>
01-first-steps.md<br>
02-directories<br>
03-redirection<br>
04-vim<br>
05-history<br>
06-scripting<br>
07-more-interactive-shell<br>
README.md<br>
quickref.md<br>
sequence.gb<br>
slides<br>
vader.txt<br>

_ echo My username is $USER

echo My home directory is $HOME

echo The contents of the tfcb_2023/lectures/lecture04/ directory are $(ls /workspaces/tfcb_2024_copy/lectures/lecture04)

mkdir homework02

cat question01.sh > question01.txt

mv question01.txt homework02_


## Problem 2

**20 points**

**Write a script that uses a loop to output files with specific names**


Make a single script that does the following:

Makes a new directory in homework02 called question02

In that directory, your script should make 25 new files called
file###.txt

the ### should be the numbers from a list you can find here:

tfcb_2023/homeworks/homework02/list.txt

You can make the contents of those files whatever you want (hint: slide 9... )

_mkdir question02

cd question02

for i in $(cat /workspaces/tfcb_2024_copy/homeworks/homework02/list.txt); 

do echo hello$i > file$i.txt;

done_
